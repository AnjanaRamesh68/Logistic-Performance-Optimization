"Logistics" refers to the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient flow and storage of goods, services, and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption. It encompasses various activities such as transportation, inventory management, warehousing, packaging, and distribution. A smooth and efficient logistic flow is vital for any business. 
This project involves creating a Power BI dashboard to track the KPI(Key Performance Indicators) such as Delivery Rate, Returns Rate , Wait times and unload delays for different cluster hubs.
